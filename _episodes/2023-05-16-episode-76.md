title: What is money?
subtitle: ""
description: In this episode, we explored key concepts such as what is a token, what is an NFT, what is money and how a coat check works. These elements will help understand the design behind blockchain systems. We differentiated between ERC-20/bitcoin and ERC-721/NFT, and how they relate to conventional money and coat check systems. Get ready for the next week''s workshop!
