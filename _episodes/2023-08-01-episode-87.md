title: PA sales tax
subtitle: ""
description: Discusses PA's sales tax on NFTs, with a spotlight on how they are defined and taxed. Surprisingly, regulations date back to 2016, but there was no retroactive enforcement before May 2022. The hosts highlight a loophole where NFTs linked to non-taxable items, like clothing, could avoid tax. They also delve into Su Squares, NFTs that allow pixel edits since 2018. Major queries raised include defining transfers and creations in the NFT world. The episode critiques PA's documentation style and juxtaposes regulations with real-world NFT products, underscoring potential inconsistencies.
