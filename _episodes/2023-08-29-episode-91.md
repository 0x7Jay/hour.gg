title: Platzi
subtitle: La comunidad de aprendizaje donde desarrollas tus habilidades
description: Platzi, a learning community geared towards the Spanish-speaking audience. Naty, from Platzi, sheds light on the platform's vision, fostering a sense of community beyond mere content delivery. The importance of blockchain in Latin America was underscored, given the tech and language barriers. Platzi, with its eight different schools, emphasizes hands-on experiences like hackathons. The episode also touches on the broader perspective of blockchain's reception in Latin American governments, with countries like Argentina being rather skeptical. Another key highlight is the exploration of a technical Solidity issue about exponential decay presented by @037. The overarching theme emphasizes learning through doing, with a nod to Platzi's impactful role in the tech education space.
