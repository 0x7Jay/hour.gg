## Quick notes and links

- [Movement Labs](http://Movementlabs.xyz): Aims to bring modularity and interoperability to non-EVM smart contract languages, but does it add unnecessary complexity?
- [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/): A big company and government initiative for content authenticity, but will it really be any more effective than YouTube content ID?
